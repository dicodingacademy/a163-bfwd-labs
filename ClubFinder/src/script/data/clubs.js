    description: 'Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Holloway, London which currently plays in the Premier League, the highest level of English football. One of the most successful clubs in English football, they have won 13 First Division and Premier League titles and a joint record 11 FA Cups. Arsenal\'s success has been particularly consistent: the club has accumulated the second most points in English top-flight football, hold the ongoing record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top flight, and would be placed first in an aggregated league of the entire 20th century. Arsenal is the second side to complete an English top-flight season unbeaten (in the 2003–04 season), playing almost twice as many matches as the previous invincibles Preston North End in the 1888–89 season. Arsenal was founded in 1886 in Woolwich and in 1893 became the first club from the south of England to join the Football League. In 1913, they moved north across the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury. In the 1930s, they won five League Championship titles and two FA Cups. After a lean period in the post-war years they won the League and FA Cup Double, in the 1970–71 season, and in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, won two more Doubles and reached the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. Since neighbouring Tottenham Hotspur, the two clubs have had a fierce rivalry, the North London derby. Arsenal have one of the highest incomes and largest fanbases in the world. The club was named the fifth most valuable association football club in the world, valued at £1.3 billion in 2014.',

    description: 'A.F.C. Bournemouth is a football club playing in the Championship, the second tier in the English football league system. The club plays at Dean Court in Kings Park, Boscombe, Bournemouth, Dorset and have been in existence since 1899. Nicknamed The Cherries, the team traditionally played in red shirts with white sleeves until 1971, when the strip was changed to red and black stripes, similar to that of A.C. Milan. A predominantly red shirt was chosen for the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons before announcing a return to the stripes for the 2006–07 season due to fan demand. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League in the 2008–09 season, Bournemouth were promoted to League One at the end of the 2009–10. After making the League One play-off semi-finals in 2010–11 and achieving a mid-table finish in 2011–12, Bournemouth won promotion to the Championship at the end of the 2012–13 season, putting them in the second tier of the league for only the second time in their history. Although the exact date of the club\'s foundation is not known, there is proof that it was formed in the autumn of 1899 out of the remains of the older Boscombe St. John\'s Lads’ Institute F.C. The club was originally known as Boscombe F.C.. The first President was Mr. J.C. Nutt. In their first season 1889–90 Boscombe F.C. competed in the Bournemouth and District Junior League. They also played in the Hants Junior Cup. During the first two seasons they played on a football pitch in Castlemain Avenue, Pokesdown. From their third season the team played on a pitch in King\'s Park. In the season of 1905–06 Boscombe F.C. graduated to senior amateur football. In 1910 the club was granted a long lease upon some wasteland next to Kings Park, as the clubs football ground, by their president Mr. J.E. Cooper-Dean. With their own ground, named Dean Court after the benefactor, the club continued to thrive and dominated the local football scene. Also in 1910 the club signed their first professional football player B. Penton. Around about this time the club obtained their nickname \'The Cherries\'. Foremost there are two tales on how the club gained this pet name. First, because of the cherry-red striped shirts that the team played in and, perhaps more plausible, because Dean Court was built adjacent to the Cooper-Dean estate, which encompassed numerous cherry orchards. For the first time during the season of 1913–14 the club competed in the F.A. Cup. The clubs progress was halted in 1914 with the outbreak of the war and Boscombe F.C. returned to the Hampshire league. In 1920 the Third Division was formed and Boscombe were promoted to the Southern League, with moderate success.',

    description: 'Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club /ˈbraɪtən ən ˈhoʊv/ is an English football club based in the coastal city of Brighton & Hove, East Sussex. It is often referred to just as Brighton. They currently play in the Football League Championship, the second tier of the English football league system. The team is nicknamed the \"Seagulls\" or \"Albion\". The team has historically played in blue and white stripes, though this changed to all white briefly in the 1970s and again to plain blue during the club\'s most successful spell in the 1980s. Crystal Palace is considered the club\'s main rival, although the grounds are 40 miles apart. Founded in 1901, Brighton played their early professional football in the Southern League before being elected to the Football League in 1920. The club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the First Division and reached the 1983 FA Cup Final, losing to Manchester United after a replay. They were relegated from the top division in the same season. Mismanagement brought Brighton close to relegation from the Football League to the Conference which they narrowly avoided in 1997 and 1998. A boardroom takeover saved Brighton from liquidation, and following successive promotions they returned to the second tier of English football in 2002 and have played in the second and third tiers ever since.',

    description: 'Crystal Palace Football Club is an English professional football club based in South Norwood, London. They currently play in the highest level in English football, the Premier League. Since 1964, the club have mostly played in the top two leagues of English football. The club was founded in 1905 at the site of the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building by the owners of the FA Cup Final stadium, who wanted their own team to play at the historic venue. Palace applied to be elected to The Football League, but this was rejected and they instead joined the Southern Football League Second Division, playing home games at The Crystal Palace, inspiration for the club\'s initial nickname, \\\"The Glaziers\\\". Palace won the Division and promotion in their first season, and played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1920 the Southern League Division One formed the Football League Third Division. Palace won the division and gained promotion to the Second Division, where they spent four seasons before suffering relegation to the Third Division South. In 1958 a league re-organisation saw Palace become founder members of Division Four. Over the next eleven years the club moved from the lowest rung of English Football to the highest, reaching the First Division in 1969, and staying in the top division for four seasons before suffering successive relegations. In 1973 the club modernised its image, changing the nickname from The Glaziers to \\\"The Eagles\\\" and ending the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. The club stabilised itself in the top two divisions with promotions in 1977 and 1979, the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two Champions. The period between 1989–91 was a successful time for the club. They reached an FA Cup Final in 1990, won the Full Members Cup in 1991, and achieved third place in the top division in the 1990–1991 season. Palace became founder members of the Premier League in 1992, but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club then achieved promotion back to the Premier League three times in 1994, 1997 and 2004, but each time suffered relegation at the end of the following season. Palace entered administration in both 2000 and 2010, and are now owned by a consortium of four. The club were promoted back to the Premier League with a 1–0 win over Watford in the Football League play-offs in May 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrystal Palace initially played their games in the grounds of The Crystal Palace, but the First World War saw them forced to move out, and they enjoyed a number of seasons at both the Herne Hill Velodrome and The Nest. Since 1924, Palace have played their home games at Selhurst Park. Their home colours are red and blue vertical stripes, though prior to 1973 they wore claret and pale blue after the fashion of Aston Villa.
